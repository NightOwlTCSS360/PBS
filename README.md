 # User Stories
 Our code supports the following user stories.
 
   US01: As a user, I would like to be able to create a project with estimates for materials and time because it allows me to plan ahead for a project.
   
   US02: As a user, I would like to be able to journal the progress of the project, record expenses, and track them against the projected budget so I can see how the project is developing.
